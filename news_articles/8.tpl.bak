Prologue:</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
$CITY
was a medium-sized city like many others in the United States: big,
cramped, dirty, and host to an army of homeless people living in its
streets. Despite this, the city was still in motion as always, still
full of young men and women filled with ambition and hope for the
future.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Needless
to say, not everybody was a fan of the local defense contractor.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
The
other prominent component of the community was the local state
university, a complex taking up several city blocks with modern,
glass-and-steel buildings and greenery for miles. It also happened to
be only a few blocks away from the ADAC Campus, a sprawling complex
nearly twice the size of the state university that predates the
buildings around it by at least a decade. This campus was a sea of
concrete, a forest of stark, brutalist blocks of concrete that gave
the gentrified area around it the middle finger simply by existing.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
&ldquo;A
Domineering Arsehole&rdquo; suddenly seems a lot more fitting when
you look at it that way.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Two
blocks south of the university, there was a struggling art student
from Austria suddenly struck by inspiration as she crossed the street
after exiting a cafe, starting her on a journey that would forever
change the way she looked at the world around her. Her medical
insurance paid for the trip to the Emergency Room and subsequent
hospitalization, but the driver responsible was never found.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Fortunately,
this is not her story.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Instead,
it is the story of the man who bowled her over, an ADAC engineer who
showed up in the office only to be pulled aside by HR and told he was
fired. 
</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
ADAC
is a company that has been in the area for longer than anybody can
remember. So long, in fact, that nobody&rsquo;s quite sure what the
company&rsquo;s name is supposed to stand for anymore. Some say it
stands for &ldquo;Air Defense Armaments Corporation,&rdquo; others
say it means &ldquo;Anderson-Douglas Armaments Corporation,&rdquo;
and others still insist that it ought to mean &ldquo;A Domineering
Arsehole&rsquo;s Corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Walking
out of ADAC&rsquo;s headquarters was a middle-aged man in a dress
shirt, tie, and khakis. In his arms was a cardboard box containing
what would&rsquo;ve been his hopes and dreams for the future had this
happened twenty years ago. Now, it was just another box with the
contents of his desk in it. After much hunting around in the massive
parking structure that had his car, he drove off, planning to buy
some whiskey before heading home. This is his story.</p>

Chapter
I:</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
It
was a sweltering July day in $CITY. The sun mercilessly beat down on
the city, and people rushed from building to building in an effort to
avoid the awful heat with Air Conditioning. Unfortunately for our
recently laid off character, he was stuck behind the wheel in a
thirtysomething-year-old car moving at all of three miles an hour in
the crime against humanity that was rush hour. The car, old enough to
run for president, was falling apart at the seams despite careful
maintenance by the now-fired engineer that drove it, and the air
conditioning decided to go on strike after being overworked for two
hours in one of the hottest days of the summer. Thus, we find our
protagonist sitting at a red light next to a school bus with his
window open.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
A
kid in the school-bus looks out his window, equally tired of sitting
in the traffic and in search of something to do. He spots the car
next to him, a boring old car with an equally boring old man sitting
inside of it. Looking at the graded answer sheet in his hands, he
gets an idea. Two seconds later, a window on the school bus is
cracked open and out flies a paper airplane, which then hits the
already irritated engineer in the head.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
At
this point, the engineer decides he&rsquo;s had it up to <i>here</i>
with the day&rsquo;s events and steps on the gas, forgetting that he
was at a red light. He knocks over a young woman who was crossing the
street, and rushes to the other side before anybody could process
what the hell just happened.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
-----</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Getting
out of his car, our protagonist in search of hard liquor checked his
watch.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
&ldquo;Six
twenty-five,&rdquo; said the watch, quietly ticking away on his
wrist. That gave him a few more minutes to buy his whisky and get out
of there&mdash;the county didn&rsquo;t allow liquor sales after
six-forty.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Hastily
closing the car door behind him, he ran towards the still-open glass
doors of the establishment. The middle-aged engineer in search of
chemically-assisted escapism rushed inside, sliding on the store&rsquo;s
freshly mopped linoleum floor before arresting his momentum using the
thankfully dry countertop. Walking down the second aisle, he swiftly
located what he was looking for&mdash;a cheap bottle of mass-produced
whisky sitting on the second shelf.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Grabbing
two bottles, he walked back to the counter.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Looking
through the doorway, he saw a man leaning through the window of a
car.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
&ldquo;Blue,&rdquo;
thought the recently laid off engineer, still occupied by the thought
of getting completely and utterly smashed when he got home. The word
wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
The
man behind the counter, a young man who might not have been able to
legally purchase the products he was selling, was preoccupied with
his phone. Clearing his throat, the still-sober engineer who wished
he wasn&rsquo;t placed his two bottles of liquid escapism onto the
counter.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re
closed,&rdquo; mumbled the employee, not even taking his eyes off of
his phone to look at the man in front of him.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
&ldquo;What
do you mean, you&rsquo;re closed? It&rsquo;s not even six thirty yet,
for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
&ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; The young man behind the counter turns around and
looks at the clock on the wall behind him. 
</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Six
twenty-nine.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
look like it,&rdquo; replies the employee, slightly louder. This
time, he briefly looks up at the person who had disrupted his anime
before going back to ignoring him.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Not
in the mood to put up with under-motivated government employees, the
alcohol-deprived man who <i>really</i> needs to get a few drinks in
his system as soon as possible before he decides to go murder
somebody grabs the phone propped up on the counter by a pack of
cigarettes. The phone, blissfully unaware of the situation, continues
doing what it was doing before being picked up.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
A
red-headed anime girl is seen cheerfully molesting a blue-haired girl
with glasses on the screen.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
The
employee, furious at the man who took his waifu away from him, lunges
for the phone. Unfortunately, both his feet were resting against the
stool he was sitting on. After his third failed attempt at taking
back his phone, the stool decided it had enough of this shit and
promptly tipped over, sprawling its occupant over onto the counter.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
&ldquo;I
just got laid off, and I am <i>not
</i>in
the mood to stay sober.&rdquo; growled the
man-who-was-incredibly-frustrated-by-the-fact-that-he-was-still-sober.
&ldquo;Let me pay for the whisky and you can go back to your
cartoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Groaning,
the employee propped himself back up, and sold our main character the
liquor he wanted.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Having
decided that he <i>really</i>
didn&rsquo;t want to stay lucid any longer than he absolutely had to,
he quickly made his way back to the car. His first hint that
something was amiss was that his window was down. Sluggishly
processing the sight before him, he opened the door and looked
inside. Sure enough, his briefcase was missing and the floor was
covered with little bits of glass.</p>
<p >
<br/>

</p>
<p >
Kicking
the side of the car in frustration, the now-robbed engineer sat down
on the pavement next to the car. Looking at the bag in his left hand,
he pulled out a bottle and twisted it open. One swig became two, two
became three, and before he knew it he was finished with the first
bottle and passed out on the pavement.</p>
